# Monitoring a Fronius PV Infrastructure

Request monitoring data from a Fronius PV inverter's Rest API, foreward and 
store it in an InfluxDB for visualization in Grafana. Current application 
collects the most fundamental Fronius inverter data serving for a basic setup. 
If your installation is any different or even more advanced, 
some extra work may be reqired, though.

Furthermore, weather forecasts, i.e. the "Surface short-wave (solar) radiation 
downwards", are downloaded from the
[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)]([https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/DAC/ECMWF+open+data%3A+real-time+forecasts+from+IFS+and+AIFS), 
in order to predict the (day-by-day) energy to be expected by the PV installation 
for the upcoming 10 days. In parallel similar data is downloaded from the 
[Global Forecast System](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/gfs/) of 
NCEP (NOAA). Latter dataset comprises a 16-day forecast with a 1 hr 
temporal resolution for the first 120 hrs and a resolution of 3 hrs. 
thereafter. The spatial resolution of the GFS data is 0Â°.11 $\equiv$ 12 km.
Moreover, an additional forecast, differing in direct and diffuse sunlight, 
is downloaded from [Free Weather API](https://open-meteo.com/).

# Fronius Endpoints 
This application collects data from the following endpoints (Symo GEN24 6.0).
For further reading see the appropriate
[API](https://www.fronius.com/~/downloads/Solar%20Energy/Operating%20Instructions/42,0410,2012.pdf). Adjust fronius host and path accordingly (see [parameter.json](https://github.com/Tamburasca/fronius2influx/blob/main/src/data/parameter.json))

# influxDB v2
All monitoring data is stored in bucket "Fronius", comprising the following measurements:

* "DeviceStatus": status of inverter (no dashboard available in Grafana).
* "CommonInverterData": values which are cumulated to generate a system overview
* "Battery": charging status, (dis-)charging demand (voltage and current), temperature
* "SmartMeter": detailed information about Meter devices.
* "SolarData": calculated energy on each panel group, as function of the 
geolocation of the PV installation, solar position, and attenuation owing to airmass.  
* "Forecast": predicted solar fluxes (units of kWh) on all PV panels 
as cumulated over the step size provided by ECMWF for the next 10 days, GFS
for the next 16 days, and open-meteo for a time horizon of 14 days. 
Forecast data is updated 4 times a day - according to the cron job in docker. 
Related fields: "ssdr" (ECMWF), "dswrf" (GFS), and "forecast" (open-meteo).

Moreover, in bucket "aggregates" the measurement "daily" represents a 
materialized view over all energy data aggregated to one day, such as:
* Battery (dis-)charged
* Net (from/to)
* Power consumed
* Power solar
* Produced In
* Usage Direct

The dashboards "Aggregates Daily and Monthly" query on this measurement. The 
[task](https://github.com/Tamburasca/fronius2influx/blob/main/docker/data/influxdb2/explorer/downsample.flux) for the creation of the 
materialized view runs once a day triggered by an influxDB scheduler.

As for the influxDB clients
there's also a version available that utilizes the asynchronous version. 
Enabled, it turned out to be >2 times slower than the synchronous version.

# Architecture 
The current installation runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 B (with 4 GB RAM and a 
64 GB SD card) inside a Docker infrastructure, comprising four containers. 
![Architecture](https://github.com/Tamburasca/fronius2influx/blob/main/pics/FroniusAPP_2.png)

    cd docker
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d

Please create the token files inside [docker/data/secrets](https://github.com/Tamburasca/fronius2influx/tree/main/docker/data/secrets/README.md) 
appropriately. The tokens for read and write access to the influxDB are 
visible in the docker-compose logs after first initialization.

# Visualization
available via Grafana 
[dashboards](https://github.com/Tamburasca/fronius2influx/tree/main/docker/data/grafana/etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards) 
and 
[influxDB flux](https://github.com/Tamburasca/fronius2influx/tree/main/docker/data/influxdb2/explorer).

# Wallbox: Wattpilot
Thanks to [Wattpilot](https://github.com/joscha82/wattpilot)
we implemented parts of their coding to account for monitoring the 
energy consumption of the wallbox. This implementation is not thoroughly 
tested yet in the absence of an electric car :flushed:

# Caveat
The current setup 
considers photovoltaic modules on either side of the rooftop. 
For other cases, adjust the FLUX statements (in Grafana) appropriately, i.e.
the setup is not generic.

# Advisory 
Currently - on a Raspberry PI 4 - influxDB is writing to an SD card. Its write
cycles may be limited. The number of writes per time interval is reduced by
increasing the WRITE_CYCLE > 1, e.g. to 12, such that data is cached and written
to the SD card 1 min<sup>-1</sup>.
